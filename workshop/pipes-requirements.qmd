# Welcome to the HPC-Pipes workshop 
:::

#### <span style="color: red;">PLEASE READ BEFORE COURSE!</span>

## Course requirements 

:::{.callout-warning title="Required preparation"}
You are expected to complete the required setup, including tool installation (Docker) and account creation (UCloud). 

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - click on `Download Docker Desktop`

As for other software, we will provide access to a Danish HPC platform, UCloud, with all the necessary software pre-installed. **Please read [Using UCloud for exercises](#using-ucloud-for-exercises) carefully**. 

**If you prefer to run the exercises on your personal laptop or a different server, please ensure you have the following software installed:**

- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) - miniconda or miniforge recommended. 
- [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) use conda for this!
- [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html)
- [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/latest/installation.html), formerly known as [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#).

### Using UCloud for exercises 

:::{.callout-warning}
Follow the instructions below if you have an account at a Danish university. You will need your institutional email to proceed. Unfortunately, this will not work for those without a university email.
:::

1. Create an account on [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/) with your institution's credentials 
2. Use the link below to join our workspace where you will find a setup environment^[*link activated a week before the workshop*.]

## Discussion and feedback

We hope you enjoyed the workshop. As data scientists, we also would be really happy for some quantifiable info and feedback - we want to build things that the Danish health data science community is excited to use. <b>Please, fill up the [feedback form]() before you head out for the day ^[*link activated on the day of the workshop*.].</b>

#### About the National Sandbox project 

The Health Data Science Sandbox aims to be a **training resource for bioinformaticians, data scientists, and those generally curious about how to investigate large biomedical datasets**. We are an active and developing project **seeking interested users** (both trainees and educators). All of our open-source materials are available on our [Github page](https://github.com/hds-sandbox) and can be used on a computing cluster! We work with both [UCloud](https://cloud/sdu.dk), [GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk) and [Computerome](https://www.computerome.dk/), the major Danish academic supercomputers.
