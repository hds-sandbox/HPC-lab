Follow these steps to run the exercises on UCloud. First, mount the following two drives, use the `setup.sh` initialization file and ask for 2 CPUs so we can run things in parallel: 

- `YourNameSurname#xxxx`: save your results/files here. 
- `hpclab-workshop`: this contains input files and scripts. You can read-only access from this directory (no write permissions). 

Next, activate `snakemake` environment. 

```{.bash}
# make sure no other env is active!
conda activate snakemake 
```

Finally, navigate to your personal drive and use the project directory you created yesterday `hpclab` to create a new subdir `fastmixture` and save here all files from this exercise (Snakefile, config.yml, output file, etc.).

</div>

<div class="tab-pane fade" id="locally" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="locally-tab">

You can choose to run your tasks either locally or on an accessible HPC. Refer to the [Welcome page](./pipes-requirements.txt) for the software you need to install. Next, create a new environment using the YAML file, activate the conda environment and download the data.

  <a href="./data/snakemake.yml" download="snakemake.yml">
    <button class="btn small-button">Download environment file</button>

# Day 2 - Part 4 

Create workflows that are both **reproducible** and easy to distribute. Use the `config.yml` file to define all variable values, and rely on separate environment YAML files for tasks that use software outside of the provided Conda environment.

# II - Admixture analysis pipeline

In this exercise, you will run the software `fastmixture` as a Snakemake pipeline by converting the following bash script. Pay attention to the prefix for input and output files and the specified number of cores. 

- File paths for UCloud users: 
  - Rscript: `/work/HPCLab_workshop/scripts/plotAdmixture.R`
  - Input PLINK files: `/work/HPCLab_workshop/data/plink_sim/sim.small.*`

`fastmixture` is not pre-installed in the `snakemake` environment and we don't want to include it for the purpose of this exercise. You will have to git clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rosemeis/fastmixture). There are two options on how to proceed:

1. Use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a new environment, which you are going to name `fastmixture`. Then, use the full path to the `fastmixture` env in the workflow. Is this the best approach? The workflow will rely on this environment being present on a new system where the workflow is executed. Referring to an existing environment can however be useful during development, e.g. when a certain software package is developed in parallel to a workflow that uses it.
2. Provide the path to `environment.yml` within the workflow. Snakemake will create the env for you which takes some time but will only do this once. This is recommended and preferred for reproducibility reasons. 

Either way, use the `conda` directive!

Have a look at the `fastmixture.sh` script below. How many different wildcards would you need? Recommended: Specify the values of the wildcard variables in a separate config file. 

```{.bash filename="fastmixture.sh"}
### Run fastmixture for K=2,3 and three different seeds
FPREFIX="sim.small"
THREADS=4 

for k in {2,3}
do
	for s in {1..3}
	do
		fastmixture --bfile $FPREFIX --K $k --threads $THREADS --seed $s --out $FPREFIX
	done
done
# Saves three files for each run (.Q, .P and .log)

### Plot results and save (using R)
for k in {2,3}
do
	for s in {1..3}
	do
		Rscript plotAdmixture.R $FPREFIX.K${k}.s${s}.Q
	done
done
```

In `fastmixture`, the main arguments used in this exercise are:

- `--K`: Specifies the number of ancestral components, representing the sources in the mixture model.
- `--seed`: Sets the random seed to ensure reproducibility of the analysis across different runs.
- `--bfile`: prefix for PLINK files (.bed, .bim, .fam)
- `--out`: Prefix output name

You are set to write your own snakemake pipeline. Need more suggestions?

- Add a `log` directive to every rule. It is best practice to store all log files in a subdirectory `logs/`, prefixed by the rule or tool name.
- Add a `benchmark` directive as well. Applying the same best practice. 
- Memory estimated based on the size of the file 
- After running the workflow for the set of `K` and `s` values shown in the bash script. Use the command line to provide a new seed value: `--config PARAM=<value>`
- Make use of the [`multiext`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#the-multiext-function) function to define a set of output or input that only differ by their extension


How to run this workflow? See the picture below:

```{.bash}
# Option A. From the terminal (do not `open interface`)
snakemake -c1 --sdm conda --config SEEDS=4
# Option B. From coder interface (for this option you can click on `open interface`)
/work/HPCLab_workshop/miniconda3/envs/snakemake/bin/snakemake -c1 --sdm conda --config SEEDS=4
```
![Click on terminal](./images/terminal_vscode.png)

:::{.callout-hint}
First, create a config.yaml file to specify the values for the wildcards `k` and `s`, as well as other parameters (such ass the number of threads, and the prefix).

Then, create the Snakemake Workflow, defining two rules for running `fastmixture` and plotting with R. 

`fastmixture` is not pre-installed, check the instructions [`fastmixture` GitHub](https://github.com/Rosemeis/fastmixture). Need more tips? 

```{.bash}
# git clone on your working dir
git clone https://github.com/Rosemeis/fastmixture.git

# get the path to the environment file
# realpath: /work/<NameSurname#xxx>/fastmixture/environment.yml
cd /work/<NameSurname#xxx>/fastmixture
conda env create -f environment.yml --prefix /work/<NameSurname#xxx>/envs/fastmixture
````

Make use of useful directive:

```{.python}
rule ...:
  output: "results/{wd2}.tsv"
  conda: "/path/to/env.yml"
  log: "logs/{wd1}.log"
  benchmark: "logs/{wd1}.txt"
  shell: "somecomamnd {output}"
```
