## Generate SSH Key Pair

Navigate to the location where all SSH keys are stored to generate a new one (**skip** these first two commands if you haven't used SSH keys before). 

```{.bash filename="Mac/Linux"}
cd ~/.ssh 
```
&#32;
```{.bash filename="Windows"}
cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh
```

We will specify the type of key to create with the option `-t` (default) and use a filename that describes what the key is for (e.g. `id_UCloud`), and don't enter a passphrase:

```{.bash}
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
```

```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/gsd818/.ssh/id_ed25519): id_UCloud
Your identification has been saved in id_UCloud
Your public key has been saved in id_UCloud.pub
...
```

## Windows users (skip otherwise)

```{.bash filename="On Powershell"}
# By default the ssh-agent service is disabled. Configure it to start automatically.
# Make sure you're running as an Administrator.
Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic

# Start the service
Start-Service ssh-agent

# This should return a status of Running
Get-Service ssh-agent
```
&#32;

```{.bash filename="On WSL"}
eval `ssh-agent -s`
```

&#32;
On MombaXterm, follow the instructions [here](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/WIKI/pages/37388673/Creating+and+using+an+SSH+key+pair+with+MobaXterm).

Once, we have generated your SSH keys, add the key to your system:

```{.bash}
## Now load your key files into ssh-agent
ssh-add id_UCloud
```

Do you get a message similar to this?

```
entity added: id_UCloud (gsd818@SUN1029429)
```

Then, copy the public key, either using `cat` to print the content of the file or as follows:

```{.bash}
cat id_UCloud.pub | pbcopy 
```

---

You can now paste the public SSH key on UCloud. You'll need to enable SSH access when you submit a job so you can SSH in.

Submit a new job on UCloud and configure SSH access

Once the job starts, the SSH command appears in the progress view and can be run locally from your terminal
