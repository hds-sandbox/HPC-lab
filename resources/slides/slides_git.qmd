## Generate SSH key Pair

Navigate to the location where all SSH keys are stored to generate a new one. Use a file name that describes what the key is for and do not enter passphrase for "id_UCloud".  

```{.bash}
# For Mac/Linux
cd ~/.ssh 
# For Windows
cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
```
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/gsd818/.ssh/id_ed25519): id_UCloud
Your identification has been saved in id_UCloud
Your public key has been saved in id_UCloud.pub
...
```
Add the key to your sytem:
```{.bash}
ssh-add id_UCloud
```
```
entity added: id_UCloud (gsd818@SUN1029429)
```

---

Then, copy the public key, either using `cat` to print the content of the file or as follows:

```{.bash}
cat id_UCloud.pub | pbcopy 
```

You can now paste the public SSH key on UCloud. You will need to enable SSH access when you submit a job to be able to ssh in.

When a job with SSH access enabled starts, the command for accessing the job from your local computer via SSH is displayed from the jobâ€™s progress view. You can run this on your terminal locally. 

```{.bash}
ssh ucloud@ssh.cloud.sdu.dk -p <1234>
```

## Connecting Git and GitHub

First, we need to create token classic. Go to your profile and on the left-side menu select `Settings > Developer settings (at the bottom) > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token`. Do not set a expiration date and name it as you'd like (e.g. ucloud hpc). Please, remember to **save** the generated token somewhere locally and safe. You won't be able to see it again. 

Then, we will generate SSH key on UCloud following these steps
  1. Submit a new job and mount your personal drive
  2. Change directory to your personal drive (e.g. `cd /work/myNameXXX/`)
  3. Create a new folder named `ssh`
  4. Generate a new key (no need for paraphrase) `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` and save it as `id_repo1`
  5. Copy the public key (`id_repo1.pub`)
  6. Add the key to the repository you have forked from us on GitHub
  7. Modify the initialization bash script to include this code

  ```
  eval `ssh-agent -s`
  ssh-add /work/ssh/id_repo1
  git config --global user.name "add here your name"
  git config --global user.email "add here your email"
  bash -i 
  ```

You can now git commit and push using the token as password to save all changes to your repository.
