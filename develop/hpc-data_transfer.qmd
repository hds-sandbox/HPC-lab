## Data transfer

To ensure efficient file transfers on HPC systems, we will go through: 

- Overview rsync and scp
- Basic commands

When transferring files between servers, it's important to ensure that the files are consistent. Differences in file size can occur due to variations in filesystems, but large differences might indicate an issue. Manually checking file sizes in a terminal (`ls -lh` or `du -sh`) to determine if a transfer was successful might not be ideal, as it doesn't guarantee file integrity. Using checksums provides a more reliable verification method.

You can use md5sum to verify that the file contents are identical on both servers. Run the following command on each server:

```.bash 
md5sum /path/to/file
```

Using rsync for **efficient file transfers**
`rsync` is a powerful alternative to `scp` for transferring files. It only sends data if the file has changed, making it more efficient. 


```.bash
# Transferring files between local machine-server
rsync -avz local/path/to/file user@server:/remote/path/to/file
# Transferring files between servers
rsync -avz server1:/path/to/my_folder server2:/path/to/destination_folder
```
The `-avz` flags are commonly used together for efficient file synchronization:

- `-a` (archive): preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, groups, owners, and devices while transferring files
- `-v` (verbose): display detailed information about the transfer (which files are being copied or updated)
- `-z` (compress): enables compression during transfer 

Other useful flags are: 

- `--progress`: display a progress bar (transfer speed, percentage completed, estimated time remaining, ...)
- `--partial`: ensures that partially transferred files are not discarded if the transfer is interrupted, allowing `rsync` to resume the transfer from where it left off the next time the command is run

To transfer files directly between two servers from your local workstation, ensure your SSH setup (configuration, keys, etc.) allows access to both servers. Check [this section](./ssh_keys.qmd) if you need help setting up your keys (generating, configuring and managing).

#### Advantages of rsync over scp:
`rsync` is an efficient protocol to compare and copy files between directories or server. It can resume interrupted transfers and compress files on the fly. 

- Checksum Verification: rsync checks the hashsums of files and only transfers data if the hashes differ. This ensures that only the changed parts of the files are sent  (so you can rsync a whole folder, and only the changes files will be send).
- Timestamp Preservation: Using the -a flag with rsync preserves the modified timestamps of files, which is particularly useful for tools like Snakemake.

If you prefer using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) for transferring files between a local and remote host, or between two remote hosts, here are some useful commands:

```{.bash}
# copy from local to remote
scp /home/my_laptop/files.txt username@login.server.dk:/home/username/myproject/

# If you want to copy an entire folder, use the option -r (recursive copy)
scp -r /home/my_laptop/myfolder username@login.server.dk:/home/username/myproject/

# check other options available 
scp --help 
```

#### Important rsync options:

- `-a`: Archive mode, preserves file attributes like timestamps and permissions (important if you are using snakemake).
- `-v`: Verbose mode, provides detailed information during transfer.
- -`z`: Compresses data during transfer, reducing the amount of data sent over the network.
- `-c`: Enables checksum checking, ensuring that files are identical by comparing their contents rather than just their size and modification time.
	
## Interactive transfer

For users who prefer a graphical interface, tools like Cyberduck and FileZilla can also be used for transferring files between servers.

1. Download Filezilla [here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) or Cyberduck [here](https://cyberduck.io/download/)
2. Open the app and configure the access information for your host machine (including password, username, ssh keys (if relevant) and `port: 22`). 
    - Select SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) option on Cyberduck
3. Quick connect

This will establish a secure connection to your host. You can navigate through your folders and files. Right-click on any file  you want to download or preview.

- **Filezilla**: your local files will be display on the left-side of the dashboard. Right-click on them to upload or add it them to a transfer queue. If you have created a queue, this will be shown at the bottom of the window as a list. You can inspect destination folders from there and choose other options such as transfer priority. To start a queue, use `CTRL + P, Transfer --> Process Queue` or use the toolbar.  
- **Cyberduck**: you can drag files from your local to the host, choose the directory where you want them located.
