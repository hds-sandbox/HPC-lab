Put your learning to the test with what youâ€™ve covered so far.

## General HPC launch 
Which of the following operations I should do from the front-end (login) nodes:

**1. Unzip a large file `unzip myfile.zip` to decompress the file?** `r torf(FALSE)`

**2. Small folders and files managment?** `r torf(TRUE)`

**3. Heavy data transfers?** `r torf(FALSE)`

**4. Run computations?** `r torf(FALSE)`

:::{.callout-hint}
Avoid running anything from the login node as this will slow down all other users. Create instead an **interactive session** to do this! 
:::

Are the following statements true or false?

**5. Is it a good idea to keep data in the scratch folder until the project is finished?** `r torf(FALSE)`

**6. I must backup all generated files, inlcuding intermediate files, to make sure the analysis are reproducible.** `r torf(FALSE)`

**7. I should not fill up my home folder with data. ** `r torf(TRUE)`

**8. Virtual environments keeps project-specific software and their dependencies separted - without interferring with each other. ** `r torf(TRUE)`

**9. I must always run the analysis/pipeline on a small subset of the data to estimate CPU/RAM resources.** `r torf(TRUE)`
